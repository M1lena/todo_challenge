"do this" to-do app. 

Phase 1, project set-up: setting up MVW* for project; configuring Karma and setting up first test to check for controller (lifted straight off of GitHub Angular project).

====================

After studying angular documentation, tutorials, and examples, I could only get the task list to work by using $scope rather than self (var self = this).

I did want to write code based strictly on tests but in the interest of just starting out with Angular and wanting to poke around a bit, I have to say, this project was not very test-driven at all. To the point where I think I even left a "backend flush" method in my specs that I wasn't using/didn't need.

Although this app does very little (tasks are checked off but never really deleted), I felt as though every step took an hour's worth of research.

I would say my biggest struggle, beyond working with Angular, is setting up the tests. I didn't even move on to the end-to-end testing with protractor because I couldn't even get my unit tests passing.

If I were to finish it, I would like to do so by starting off with writing better tests.
